# get_next_line


A series of articles were extremely helpful for me to understand how to approach the project: [42 Get Next Line Guide (String Approach)](https://medium.com/@lannur-s/gnl-c3cff1ee552b). I learned a lot from this article about how to structure the project, proper memory management, and creative thinking/problem-solving.
During this project I also came across the term ["memory-ownership"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60046802/understanding-memory-ownership-models-in-c). This concept has been helpful for me to understand and appreciate programmers' decisions of creating specific functions, and which of these take care of allocating and/or freeing memory. This was crucial for me to avoid memory leaks and double freeing.
